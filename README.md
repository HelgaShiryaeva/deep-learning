# Hello,
## here you can find some demos, models, training processes and utils
## that helpled me to solve some problems dedicated to classification
## and detection
## 
## Things tried and pleasant tools :
## 
# Images:
## 
## - Image preprocessing
## - Augmentation
## - Real-time webcam testing
## - Image labeling
## - Drawing bounding-boxes tool for YOLO
## 
# Number recognition and detection :
##
## - Training MobileNet on custom dataset (classification)
## - Training VGG16 on custom dataset (classification)
## - Training YOLO on custom dataset (detection + classification)
## - Mask detection (sensitive to color)
## - Training simple Keras model made from scratch (classification)
##
## 
# American Sign Language classification  (Comparison analysis of convolutional neural networks structure)
## - Training Keras models
## - Comparison analysis of productivity and results
